I'm a Data ScientistðŸ“Š, looking to solve real-world problems with machine learning ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ . I'm passionate about learning DS and entering a great field. I hope to soon begin working with real companies so I can help show the amazing potential of data.

</h2>
  
| Project Name  | Description   | Sprint Number  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| [Interconnect Final Project](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2017%20Interconnect%20Final%20Project.ipynb)  | Used machine learning and data balancing techniques to create a predictive model for churn producing an AUC-ROC >0.85. | 15 |
| [Good Seed](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2015%20Good%20Seed.ipynb) | Use supplied photos and starter code to build and test a regression model that predicts age (on a continuous scale) from a photo. | 14 |
| [Film Junky Union](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2014%20Film%20Junky%20Union.ipynb) | Train a model for classifying positive and negative reviews with a F1 score of at least 0.85. | 13 |
| [Sweet Taxi Lift](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2013%20Sweet%20Lift%20Taxi.ipynb) | Use historical data on taxi orders to predict peak hours using RMSE as the metric. | 12 |
| [Rusty Bargain](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2012%20Rusty%20Bargain.ipynb) | Generate a model that predicts the value of a car based on historical data (such as trims, prices, milage, technical specs). | 11 |
| [Sure Tomorrow](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2011%20Sure%20Tomorrow.ipynb) | Use ML to categorize customers, identify customers likely to receive an insurance benefit, and use data masking. | 10 |
| [Zyfra Gold](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%2010%20Zyfra%20Gold.ipynb) |  Find the ML model that best predicts the two target values given the predictor variables present for gold extraction from ore. | 9 |
| [Oily Giant](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%209%20OilyGiant.ipynb)  | Use ML and boostrapping to select a region with the highest profit margin given a selection of masked features. | 8 |
| [Beta Bank](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%208%20Beta%20Bank.ipynb) | Predict customer churn for a bank. | 7 |
| [Megaline Plans](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%207%20Megaline%20Plans.ipynb)  | Created a ML model that recommends an appropriate plan based on data about the behavior of subscribers who've already switched (with accuracy > 75%).  | 6 |
| [SQL Taxi Rides](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%206%20SQL%20Taxi%20Rides.ipynb) | Identify top neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs for a new ride sharming company. | 5 |
| [Ice Video Games](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%205%20Ice%20Video%20Games.ipynb) | Preliminary analysis of platform, genre, and ESRB ratings to determine any patterns that influence sales. | 4 |
| [Megaline](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%204%20Megaline.ipynb) | Analysis of phone plans, revenue, and retetion to produce recommendations for the marketing team. | 3 |
| [Crankshaft](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%203%20Crankshaft.ipynb)  | Use EDA to study data collected over the last few years from online advertisements and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.  | 2 |
| [Loan Default](https://github.com/bitfotico/practicum_projects/blob/main/Sprint%202%20Loan%20Default.ipynb) | Create a credit score for potential customers for a loan examining marital status and number of children as features. | 1 |
